          Learning is a process that isn’t specifically taught in schools. So
          people tend to think, oh im just not very smart or good at remembering
          things, that person is just gifted. And i think there is some truth to
          that, I wont lie to you, this could be a combination of a lot of
          reasons, previous education, childhood environment impact, confidence
          in oneself, and natural affinity towards specific topics. however i do
          think there is a way for everyone to become more productive, and that
          is about understanding the cycles that occur when you are learning
          something new. specifically a big topic, for ex a new language, or a
          coding language, or … Something we need to understand is our own
          personal learning cycles and the impact of passion and motivation, and
          how to inspire motivation. Most people can relate to the feeling of
          being hyperfixated on a topic at one point or another and totally
          diving into it learning a bunch but getting burnt out and demotivated
          at some point. THats when those motivation twitter gurus come in and
          say, “ oh its not about motivation its about being consistent and
          showing up every day” BUT wouldnt it be nice if you could be
          motivated? almost every day? The concepts of having a specific
          learning cycle defiently exists, however I only found out about it
          after I discovered my own cycle. So my cycle is slightly different and
          more applicable to coding or lanaguge learning specifically.
