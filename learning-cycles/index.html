          Learning isn't a skill often explicitly taught in school. So,
          people often think, "I'm just not smart enough," or "I can't remember
          things as well as that person - they must be gifted." And hey, I'm not
          going to lie, there's some truth to that. Factors like your
          educational background, your upbringing, how confident you are, and
          even a natural inclination towards certain topics can play a big part. But I
          truly believe there's a way for all of us to boost our productivity.
          It's all about understanding your personal learning cycles,
          especially when you're learning something big and new, like a
          language or coding.
          <br />
          <br />
          Most people can relate to the feeling of being hyper-fixated on a
          topic, diving into it, learning a bunch, but then getting burnt out.
          That's when those Twitter gurus tell you it's about consistency and
          discipline. But wouldn't it be nice if we could stay motivated almost
          every day?
          <br />
          <br />
          The concept of having a personal learning cycle definitely exists, but
          I only figured out mine after I began learning Mandarin and coding. My
          cycle seemed different, more effective. And it got me thinking - what
          am I doing differently? So I decided to share my process.
          <br />
          <br />
          With no experience in mandarin and only after learning for a about a
          year I had achieved a relatively high level of fluency compared to my
          peers, why? what am i doing differently that other people are not?
          same with coding, although im not sure how my speed compares to
          others, I still would like to share my process. Even if it helps just
          one other person I would be happy
          <br />
          <br />
          So here's the gist: I go through three main cycles when studying.
          Being aware of which cycle I'm in at any given moment has helped me
          stay productive without burning out. But keep in mind, for this
          process to work best, you have to actually enjoy what you're learning
          about. If it works for subjects you don't like as much, that's great,
          but no guarantees!

        <h2>CYCLE 1</h2>
        <p>
          This cycle specifically refers to the time where a person is learning
          in a structured way, many developers can understand this by thinking
          about learning on a platform like freecodecamp, scrimba, or
          codeacademy. In regard to learning a language, this could be attending
          a language course, or following some kind of predeterimined path, like
          a textbook. During this process you will be introduced to fundemental
          concepts essential to the topic you are learning about. I will use my
          experience doing the FreeCodeCamp responsive web design course as an
          example: üë©üèª‚Äçüíª When I was doing this certification I really fell in
          loving with coding at least I thought thats what I was doing with HTML
          and CSS üòÜ During this time, I was following the specific tasks and
          assigments they gave me. Thats basically it. And here is an example of
          what this would look like learning Mandarin: üÄÑ This would look like
          following a textbook from the most basic point, and memorizing words
          using anki. You could attend a class or learn by yourself, but the
          fastest way is to attend a language school either online or in person.
          This will give the structure you need. Keep in mind, if you attend a
          mandarin class, this CYCLE 1 will last for the entirety of the class,
          but you could add in some of the other cycles in your spare time This
          process is very simple, and the first time you are in the structure
          cycle you should be able to spend quite a while in it, depending on
          how many hours you spend a day learning you could be here for a few
          days up to a few weeks. How do you know when to move on to the next
          cycle? well, when you are feeling bored and totally demotivated.
          Feeling like your productivity is totally gone. You know you still
          like the topic but you have been met with a sense of burnout. Then you
          move onto CYCLE 2
