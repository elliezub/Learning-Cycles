        Learning isn't a skill often explicitly taught in school. So, people
        often think, "I'm just not smart enough," or "I can't remember things
        as well as that person - they must be gifted." And hey, I'm not going
        to lie, there's some truth to that. Factors like your educational
        background, your upbringing, how confident you are, and even a natural
        inclination towards certain topics can play a big part. But I truly
        believe there's a way for all of us to boost our productivity. It's
        all about understanding your personal learning cycles, especially when
        you're learning something big and new, like a language or coding.

          Most people can relate to the feeling of being hyper-fixated on a
          topic, diving into it, learning a bunch, but then getting burnt out.
          That's when those Twitter gurus tell you it's about consistency and
          discipline. But wouldn't it be nice if we could stay motivated almost
          <strong>every day</strong>? üßê

      <p>
        The concept of having a personal learning cycle definitely exists, but
        I only figured out mine after I began learning Mandarin and coding. 
        I routinely get feedback like "you must be a
        fast learner!" or questions like "how do you plan your studies?". It got me thinking - what
        am I doing differently? So I decided to share my process.

        With no experience in mandarin and only after learning for a about a
        year I had achieved a relatively high level of fluency compared to my
        peers, why? what am i doing differently that other people are not?
        same with coding, although I'm not sure how my speed compares to
        others, I still would like to share my process. Even if it helps just
        one other person I would be happy. üòÑ

      <h4>3. Process</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        So here's the gist: I go through three main cycles when studying.
        Being aware of which cycle I'm in at any given moment has helped me
        stay productive without burning out. But keep in mind, for this
        process to work best, you have to actually enjoy what you're learning
        about. If it works for subjects you don't like as much, that's great,
        but no guarantees!

        <div class="description">
          <h3>structure</h3>
          <p>
            This cycle refers to the time where a person is
            learning in a structured way.

        </div>
      </div>
      <section class="cycle1">
      <p>
        Many developers can understand this cycle by thinking about learning on a
        platform like freeCodeCamp, Scrimba, or Codacademy. In regard to
        learning a language, this could be attending a language course, or
        following some kind of predeterimined path, like a textbook. During
        this process you will be introduced to fundemental concepts essential
        to the topic you are learning about.

          <p>
        üë©üèª‚Äçüíª When I was doing this certification I really fell in loving with
        coding at least I thought that's what I was doing with HTML and CSS üòÜ
        During this time, I was following the specific tasks and assigments
        they gave me. Thats basically it.

            üÄÑ This would look like following a textbook from the most basic
            point, and memorizing words using anki. You could attend a class or
            learn by yourself, but the fastest way is to attend a language school
            either online or in person. This will give the structure you need.
            Keep in mind, if you attend a mandarin class, this CYCLE 1 will last
            for the entirety of the class, but you could add in some of the other
            cycles in your spare time.

        <!-- conclusion of cycle 1 -->
        This process is very simple, and the first time you are in the
        structure cycle you should be able to spend quite a while in it,
        depending on how many hours you spend a day learning you could be here
        for a few days up to a few weeks.
        <br />
        <br />
        How do you know when to move on to the next cycle? well, when you are
        feeling bored and totally demotivated. Feeling like your productivity
        is totally gone. You know you still like the topic but you have been
        met with a sense of burnout.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then you move onto CYCLE 2

            The main purpose of this cycle is to inspire a new sense of

        Imagine you have been in cycle 1 studying JavaScript for a week and
        feel totally tired. You must need a break, it will be quite difficult
        to regain motivation and energy from that passion of doing something
        you enjoy if you continue doing the very thing that has burnt you out.
        This method is related to a psychological concept called the ‚Äòpuppy
        mind‚Äô.

      <div id="creativediv">
        <div>
          <p>
            The "puppy mind" is a concept used in psychology to describe the
            tendency for the mind to get easily distracted and jump from one
            thing to another, much like a playful puppy. This can lead to
            difficulty in focusing on one task for an extended period of time.
            <br /><br />
            people mostly agree that we need to train the puppy mind, and
            while I agree, there are some situations (like in cycle 2) that it
            might be beneficial to let your puppy mind run rampant.
            <br /><br />
            The point of this cycle is to get a fresh perspective on learning,
            maximize your input sources to stimulate creativity.

        Here are some examples of how this works when studying a specific
        topic.
        <br /><br />
        When studying JavaScript:
        <br /><br />
        üë©üèª‚Äçüíª So, when I first started learning JavaScript I was using
        FreeCodeCamp, It was quite alright at first but got pretty confusing,
        and although I was very motivated doing that at first I started
        getting really tired. END OF CYCLE 1
        <br /><br />
        üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Then I started researcing a bunch of free resources which led me to
        jsdares, W3Schools, and scrimba, I just let myself explore everthing.
        js dares was fun, got a better feeling for JS, completed some lessons
        on W3schools, and finally got to scrimba. which was great!! END OF
        CYCLE 2
        <br /><br />
        üë©üèª‚Äçüíª BACK TO CYCLE 1, as I said, in the beginning you might not get to 3
        right away, I started on scrimba which was great. I completed the
        majority of the intro to JS course and felt motivated the whole time
        BUT then I started getting demotivated when they switched teachers at
        the very end of the course. What to do? I went back into exploration
        mode. END OF CYCLE 1.
        <br /><br />
        üë©üèª‚Äçüíª CYCLE 2 start: this really only lasted a few hours, and was the
        moment in which I really started feeling myself going through these 3
        cycles. I thought, these resources for coding really need to be all in
        one place, and maybe everyone can access them. So I decided to make a
        PROJECT. (thats cycle 3 and will discuss next)
