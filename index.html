          Learning isn't a skill often explicitly taught in school. So, people
          often think, "I'm just not smart enough," or "I can't remember things
          as well as that person - they must be gifted." And hey, I'm not going
          to lie, there's some truth to that. Factors like your educational
          background, your upbringing, how confident you are, and even a natural
          inclination towards certain topics can play a big part. But I truly
          believe there's a way for all of us to boost our productivity. It's
          all about understanding your personal learning cycles, especially when
          you're learning something big and new, like a language or coding.

            Most people can relate to the feeling of being hyper-fixated on a
            topic, diving into it, learning a bunch, but then getting burnt out.
            That's when those Twitter gurus tell you it's about consistency and
            discipline. But wouldn't it be nice if we could stay motivated
            almost
            <strong>every day</strong>? üßê

        <br />
        <p>
          The concept of having a personal learning cycle definitely exists, but
          I only figured out mine after I began learning Mandarin and coding. I
          routinely get people telling me "you must be a fast learner!" or
          asking questions like "how do you plan your studies?". It got me
          thinking - what am I doing differently? So I decided to share my
          process.

          <p>
            With no experience learning Mandarin and only after learning for a
            about a year I had achieved a relatively high level of fluency
            compared to my peers, why? what am I doing differently that other
            people are not? same with coding, although I'm not sure how my speed
            compares to others, I still would like to share my process. Even if
            it helps just one other person I would be happy. üòÑ

        <h4>3. Process</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          So here's the gist: I go through three main cycles when studying.
          Being aware of which cycle I'm in at any given moment has helped me
          stay productive without burning out. But keep in mind, for this
          process to work best, you have to actually enjoy what you're learning
          about. If it works for subjects you don't like as much, that's great,
          but no guarantees!

          Many developers can understand this cycle by thinking about learning
          on a platform like freeCodeCamp, Scrimba, or Codacademy. In regard to
          learning a language, this could be attending a language course, or
          following some kind of predeterimined learning path, like a textbook.
          During this process you will be introduced to fundemental concepts
          essential to the topic you are learning about.

            learn by yourself, but the fastest way is to attend a language school
            either online or in person. This will give the structure you need.
            Keep in mind, if you attend a mandarin class, this CYCLE 1 will last
            for the entirety of the class, but you could add in some of the other
            cycles in your spare time.

          This process is very simple, and the first time you are in the
          structure cycle you should be able to spend quite a while in it,
          depending on how many hours you spend a day learning you could be here
          for a few days up to a few weeks.

          is totally gone. You know you still like the topic but you have been
          met with a sense of burnout.

          Imagine you have been in cycle 1 studying JavaScript for a week and
          feel totally tired. You must need a break, it will be quite difficult
          to regain motivation and energy from that passion of doing something
          you enjoy if you continue doing the very thing that has burnt you out.
          This method is related to a psychological concept called the ‚Äòpuppy
          mind‚Äô.
          <br /><br />
        </p>
        <!-- set link to puppy mind -->
        <p>
          The "puppy mind" describes the tendency for the mind to get easily
          distracted and jump from one thing to another, much like a playful
          puppy. This can lead to difficulty in focusing on one task for an
          extended period of time.
          <br /><br />
          people mostly agree that we need to train/discipline the puppy mind,
          and while I agree, there are some situations (like in cycle 2) that it
          might be beneficial to let your puppy mind run rampant.

            üë©üèª‚Äçüíª So, when I first started learning JavaScript I was using
            FreeCodeCamp, It was quite alright at first but got pretty
            confusing, and although I was very motivated doing that at first I
            started getting really tired. END OF CYCLE 1
            <br /><br />
            üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Then I started researcing a bunch of free resources which led me
            to jsdares, W3Schools, and scrimba, I just let myself explore
            everthing. js dares was fun, got a better feeling for JS, completed
            some lessons on W3schools, and finally got to scrimba. which was
            great!! END OF CYCLE 2
            <br /><br />
            üë©üèª‚Äçüíª BACK TO CYCLE 1, as I said, in the beginning you might not get to
            3 right away, I started on scrimba which was great. I completed the
            majority of the intro to JS course and felt motivated the whole time
            BUT then I started getting demotivated when they switched teachers
            at the very end of the course. What to do? I went back into
            exploration mode. END OF CYCLE 1.
            <br /><br />
            üë©üèª‚Äçüíª CYCLE 2 start: this really only lasted a few hours, and was the
            moment in which I really started feeling myself going through these
            3 cycles. I thought, these resources for coding really need to be
            all in one place, and maybe everyone can access them. So I decided
            to make a PROJECT. (thats cycle 3 and will discuss next)

      <section class="cycle2conclusion">
        <p>
          The explore cycle would generally only last for a few hours or maximum
          1 to 2 days depending on how long you spend doing this, and how burnt
          out you let yourself get from CYCLE 1.
          <br />
          <br />
          All of these new sources of input can get you inspired and ready for
          CYCLE 3. CYCLE 3 must start after CYCLE 2 has resulted in a good idea,
          otherwise you can move back to CYCLE 1. However, if you have completed
          CYCLE 2 correctly, you will have material for CYCLE 3 every time.

            Response:
            <br />
            <br />
            That's great that you're learning JavaScript and making progress in
            problem solving. As for project ideas, here are a few that are
            related to your interests and can help you practice your JS skills:
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Cat Clicker: Create a webpage with pictures of different cats.
              When a user clicks on a cat's picture, increment a counter for
              that cat. Display the number of clicks for each cat. This will
              help you practice handling events and manipulating the DOM.
            </li>
            <li>
              League of Legends Character Database: Create an object for each
              character in the game with properties like 'name', 'role',
              'abilities', etc. Then, create functions to sort and filter
              characters based on these properties. This can help you practice
              using objects and arrays.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dragon Game: This could be a simple text-based game where the
              player has a dragon that they can train and care for. Actions the
              player takes could affect the dragon's stats (like 'strength' or
              'happiness'), and those stats could affect the outcomes of events.
              This project would be a good exercise in using objects and control
              flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              Harry Potter Quiz: This could be a quiz with multiple choice
              questions about the Harry Potter series. For each question, the
              player must choose the correct answer from four options. At the
              end of the quiz, show the player their score. This will give you
              practice with arrays, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sorting Hat: Based on a series of preferences or personality test,
              sort a user into a Hogwarts House. You could ask the user a series
              of questions and then use their answers to determine their House.
              This will help you practice with forms, objects, and control flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              A simple League of Legends API client: Using Riot Games API
              (official League of Legends API), you can fetch data about
              champions, items, matches and more. Create a simple user interface
              to display the data. This can help you learn about how to work
              with APIs, asynchronous programming, and data manipulation.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />

            Remember, the goal of these projects is to learn and practice, so
            don't worry about making them perfect. Start small, and as you get
            more comfortable with JavaScript, you can add more features to your
            projects. Good luck!

          Very lovely response from chatGPT as you can see. This way, even if
          you haven't figured out a project on your own and you want to get into
          CYCLE 3 you can!
          <br />
          <br />
          Once you are finished with your project you can move back to CYCLE 1
          and learn more fundamentals and concepts.
          <br />
          <br />
          Don't be afraid to switch learning resources if something is not
          clicking with you, and make things that you are passionate about. If I
          am doing something boring I can barely concentrate for 30 minutes, if
          I am passionate I can concentrate for many hours straight!
          <br /><br />
          Happy learning!
