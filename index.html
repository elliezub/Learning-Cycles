          Learning isn't a skill often explicitly taught in school. So, people
          often think, "I'm just not smart enough," or "I can't remember things
          as well as that person - they must be gifted." And hey, I'm not going
          to lie, there's some truth to that. Factors like your educational
          background, your upbringing, how confident you are, and even a natural
          inclination towards certain topics can play a big role in your ability to learn. But I truly believe there's a way for everyone to boost their productivity when learning something new. It's
          all about understanding your personal learning cycles, especially when you're immersing yourself in expansive fields of knowledge, such as language acquisition or programming.

          The theory of having a learning cycle definitely exists (if you're interested in that you can simply google "learning cycle"), but
          I only figured out mine after I began learning Mandarin and coding. I
          routinely get people telling me "you must be a fast learner!" or
          asking questions like "how do you plan your studies?". It got me
          thinking - what am I doing differently? So I decided to share my
          process.

            people are not? same with coding, although I'm not sure how my speed
            compares to others, I still would like to share my process. Even if

          So here's the gist: I go through three main cycles when studying.
          Being aware of which cycle I'm in at any given moment has helped me
          stay productive without burning out. But keep in mind, for this
          process to work best, you have to actually enjoy what you're learning
          about. If it works for subjects you don't like as much, that's great,
          but no guarantees!

            üë©üèª‚Äçüíª When I was doing the FCC responsive web design certification I
            really fell in love with coding (at least I thought that's what I
            was doing with HTML and CSS üòÜ) During this time, I was doing
            the specific tasks and assigments they gave me.
            <br>
            <br>
            This structure acted as a sort of roadmap. I never felt lost or overwhelmed because I knew exactly where I was and what I was supposed to do next. The concrete tasks provided me with clear goals, and achieving them gave me a sense of accomplishment and motivation.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is essentially what the 'Structure' phase in the learning cycle is about. It's a guided, step-by-step journey where you're progressively introduced to core principles. It's a controlled environment where you learn, practice, make mistakes, and improve. But just like anything, after a while, things can start to feel a bit repetitive and you may find youself getting bored or burnt out.

            either online or in person. This will give the structure you need.
            Keep in mind, if you attend a mandarin class, this CYCLE 1 will last
            for the entirety of the class, but you could add in some of the other

          Imagine you have been in cycle 1 studying JavaScript for a week and
          feel totally tired. Trying to reignite your motivation and energy from the very thing that has burned you out can seem like an uphill battle.
          This is where understanding the concept of the 'puppy mind' can help.

        <!-- set link to puppy mind -->

          The "puppy mind" describes the tendency for the mind to get easily
          distracted and jump from one thing to another, much like a playful
          puppy. This can lead to difficulty in focusing on one task for an
          extended period of time.
          <br /><br />
          People mostly agree that we need to train/discipline the puppy mind,
          and while I agree, there are some situations (like in cycle 2) that it
          might be beneficial to let your puppy mind run rampant.

            üë©üèª‚Äçüíª When I first started learning JavaScript I was using
            FreeCodeCamp. At first, it was exciting. I was grasping new concepts and I was on a roll for a while. But after a while, things got pretty confusing for me and my motivation was clearly disappearing. This signaled the end of CYCLE 1. 
            <br /><br />
            üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Embracing my 'puppy mind', I decided it was time to unleash my curiosity. I started researcing a bunch of free resources which led me
            to jsdares, W3Schools, and Scrimba,  I allowed myself to explore, not fixating on one source or one thing but checking out everything that caught my interest (related to coding). I had fun with jsdares, completed
            some exercises on W3schools, and eventually discovered Scrimba, which was a great find! And that marked the end of CYCLE 2.
            <br /><br />
            üë©üèª‚Äçüíª And then, I found myself back in CYCLE 1. In the beginning you might not get to
            CYCLE 3 right away. With Scrimba, I found a structured learning path that was a perfect fit. I managed to complete most of the Introduction to JS course.
            But, motivation started to dip again when the course switched teachers at the end of the course. This signaled the end of CYCLE 1.
            <br /><br />
            üë©üèª‚Äçüíª CYCLE 2 started again, but it really only lasted a few hours, and was the
            moment in which I really started feeling myself going through these
            3 cycles. 
            During this phase I felt really inspired. 
            I realized how scattered and fragmented the resources for learning coding were. Wouldn't it be great if all of the best resources were all in one place, accessible to everyone? So I decided
            to make a project! That signaled the end of CYCLE 2 and leading us to CYCLE 3.

          The explore cycle would generally only last for a few hours or maximum
          1 to 2 days depending on your learning schedule, and how burnt out you let yourself get from CYCLE 1.

          <br />
          All of these new sources of input can get you inspired and ready for

          otherwise feel free to move back to CYCLE 1. But trust me, if you've done CYCLE 2 right, you'll be ready for CYCLE 3 every single time.

            That's great that you're learning JavaScript and making progress in
            problem solving. As for project ideas, here are a few that are
            related to your interests and can help you practice your JS skills:
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Cat Clicker: Create a webpage with pictures of different cats.
              When a user clicks on a cat's picture, increment a counter for
              that cat. Display the number of clicks for each cat. This will
              help you practice handling events and manipulating the DOM.
            </li>
            <li>
              League of Legends Character Database: Create an object for each
              character in the game with properties like 'name', 'role',
              'abilities', etc. Then, create functions to sort and filter
              characters based on these properties. This can help you practice
              using objects and arrays.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dragon Game: This could be a simple text-based game where the
              player has a dragon that they can train and care for. Actions the
              player takes could affect the dragon's stats (like 'strength' or
              'happiness'), and those stats could affect the outcomes of events.
              This project would be a good exercise in using objects and control
              flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              Harry Potter Quiz: This could be a quiz with multiple choice
              questions about the Harry Potter series. For each question, the
              player must choose the correct answer from four options. At the
              end of the quiz, show the player their score. This will give you
              practice with arrays, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sorting Hat: Based on a series of preferences or personality test,
              sort a user into a Hogwarts House. You could ask the user a series
              of questions and then use their answers to determine their House.
              This will help you practice with forms, objects, and control flow.

              A simple League of Legends API client: Using Riot Games API
              (official League of Legends API), you can fetch data about
              champions, items, matches and more. Create a simple user interface
              to display the data. This can help you learn about how to work
              with APIs, asynchronous programming, and data manipulation.

            Remember, the goal of these projects is to learn and practice, so
            don't worry about making them perfect. Start small, and as you get
            more comfortable with JavaScript, you can add more features to your
            projects. Good luck!

          Very lovely response from chatGPT as you can see. This way, even if
          you haven't figured out a project on your own and you want to get into
          CYCLE 3 you can!
          <br />
          <br />
          Once you are finished with your project you can move back to CYCLE 1
          and learn more fundamentals and new concepts.
          <br />
          <br />
          Don't be afraid to switch learning resources if something is not
          clicking with you, and make things that you are passionate about. If I
          am doing something boring I can barely concentrate for 30 minutes, but if I'm passionate, I can go for hours on end!
          <br /><br />
          Happy learning!
